Meanwhile, validators play a crucial role in supervising the network&#39;s security, maintaining stability and ensuring service quality. While validators may earn transaction fees, this alone may not be enough to guarantee sufficient staking for network security. Therefore, Greenfield has designed validators to receive a reasonable proportion of fees from the storage services they provide.
