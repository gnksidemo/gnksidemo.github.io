Once the object is stored, the total charge of storage will be mainly only related to time and the base price.</p><p>For data downloading, there is a free, time-based quota for each bucket of users&#39; objects. If it&#39;s exceeded, users can promote their data package to get more quota. Every data package has a fixed price for the defined period. Once the data package is picked, the total charge of downloading will be only related to time and the data package price, until the data package setting is changed again.</p><h3 id="payment-account" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#payment-account" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Payment Account</h3><p>By default, the object owner&#39;s address will be used to pay for the objects it owns. But users can also create multiple &quot;payment accounts&quot; and associate objects to different payment accounts to pay for storage and bandwidth.</p><p>The address format of the payment account is the same as normal accounts. It&#39;s derived by the hash of the user address and payment account index. However, the payment accounts are actually only logical ones and only exist in the storage payment module. Users can deposit into, withdraw from and query the balance of payment accounts on the Greenfield blockchain, but users cannot use payment accounts to perform staking or other on-chain transactions. Payment accounts can be set as &quot;non-refundable&quot;. Users cannot withdraw funds from such payment accounts.</p><h3 id="downgraded-service" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#downgraded-service" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Downgraded service</h3><p>Once the payment accounts run out of BNB, the objects associated with these payment accounts will suffer from a downgraded service of downloading, i.e. the download speed and connection numbers will be limited. Once the fund is transferred to the payment accounts, the service quality can be resumed right away. If the service is not resumed for a long time, it is the SPs&#39; discretionary decision to clear the data out, in a similar way to how SPs claim to stop services to certain objects. In such a case, the data may be gone from Greenfield completely.</p><div class="hint-container warning"><p class="hint-container-title">Note</p><p>If users fail to renew their subscription in a timely manner, <strong>there is a risk of their stored data being permanently deleted.</strong></p></div><h3 id="trust-or-shift" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#trust-or-shift" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Trust or Shift</h3><p>Here there is trust between the users and the SPs for data download.</p><p>As the extra downloading bandwidth will charge a fee and the download journal is not fully stored on the Greenfield blockchain. SPs provide an endpoint interface for users to query the download billing details with detailed logs and downloaders&#39; signatures.
