When this right is disconnected from the data itself, they become tradable assets and enlarge the value of the data. This can be amplified when the data itself can be executable (a new type of &quot;Smart Code&quot;), interact with each other, and generate new data. This creates a lot of room to imagine building a new, data-intensive, trustless computing environment.</p><p>Secondly, the data permissions can be transferred cross-chain onto BSC and become digital assets there. This creates a variety of possibilities to integrate these assets with the existing DeFi protocols and models on BSC.</p><p>This gets even further enhanced by the smart contracts on BSC, which enjoy the same address format as accounts on the Greenfield blockchain and can be the owners of the data objects and inherit different permissions. This will unleash many new business opportunities based on the data and its operations.</p><div class="hint-container info"><p class="hint-container-title">Info</p><p>It does not mean developers have to build dapp based on BSC network.

The first layer is the Cross-Chain Communication Layer, which is responsible for handling and verifying the communication packages between different blockchain networks. This layer serves as the backbone of the entire ecosystem, ensuring the smooth and secure transfer of information between different platforms.</p><p>The second layer is the Resource Mirror Layer, which provides a bridge between Greenfield and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This layer manages the resource assets defined on Greenfield, which are then mirrored onto BSC. The Resource Mirror Layer enables users to interact with these assets on BSC using smart contracts, which operate on the primitives defined by Greenfield. This layer plays a critical role in the Greenfield ecosystem, enabling seamless cross-chain asset management and more efficient resource allocation.</p><p>At the top of the Greenfield ecosystem is the Application Layer. This layer consists of smart contracts that are developed by the community on BSC, enabling them to operate the mirrored resource entities on the Resource Mirror Layer. While Greenfield itself does not currently offer programmability, the Application Layer allows for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that can interact with Greenfield Core and other supporting infrastructures. The Application Layer represents the true power and potential of the Greenfield ecosystem, enabling developers and users to create and leverage a wide range of innovative and decentralized applications while benefiting from Greenfield&#39;s robust infrastructure and cross-chain capabilities.</p><h2 id="cross-chain-bridge" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cross-chain-bridge" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Cross-Chain Bridge</h2><p>The native cross-chain bridge is an essential part of the Greenfield ecosystem, as it enables seamless interoperability between different blockchain networks. To ensure the security and integrity of the bridge, the validators of Greenfield have implemented a new relayer system based on an aggregated multisig scheme.</p><p>Under this system, multiple validators will collaborate to approve and execute cross-chain transactions, with each transaction requiring a certain threshold of signatures to be deemed valid. The use of an aggregated multisig scheme not only ensures greater security but also facilitates a higher bandwidth and faster bridge.</p><p>The relayer system will be continuously monitored and maintained by the validators to ensure that it is running at optimal efficiency.</p>',16),m=t("h2",{id:"get-started-with-building-dapp",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#get-started-with-building-dapp","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),e(" Get Started with building dapp")],-1);function f(u,b){const a=c("RouterLink");return o(),d("div",null,[p,t("p",null,[e("More details are discussed in "),i(a,{to:"/docs/greenfield-blockchain/modules/cross-chain.html"},{default:s(()=>[e("Cross Chain Module design")]),_:1}),e(".")]),m,t("ul",null,[t("li",null,[i(a,{to:"/docs/greenfield-blockchain/modules/cross-chain.html"},{default:s(()=>[e("Learn more about the cross-chain mechanism")]),_:1})]),t("li",null,[i(a,{to:"/docs/dapp/quick-start.html"},{default:s(()=>[e("Start building dapps with Greenfield")]),_:1})])])])}const w=n(l,[["render",f],["__file","programmability.html.vue"]]);export{w as default};
