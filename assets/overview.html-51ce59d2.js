However, their responsibilities extend well beyond that:</p><ol><li><p>Validators are tasked with achieving consensus on cross-chain events and relaying cross-chain packets to both Greenfield and BNB Smart Chain. This ensures that cross-chain transactions are executed quickly, securely, and with minimal cost.</p></li><li><p>Validators play a key role in ensuring the integrity and availability of data provided by service providers (SPs). By challenging the data availability of SPs in a specific or random manner, validators can weed out malicious actors and those who provide subpar services. Punishing such actors through appropriate measures - such as slashing their stake, for example - helps to ensure the quality and reliability of services in the Greenfield ecosystem.</p></li><li><p>Validators also have a say in the governance of the network. They vote on issues related to the future development of Greenfield&#39;s ecosystem and adjust various network parameters as necessary. This ensures that the network remains healthy and sustainable over time, while accommodating the changing needs and demands of its users.</p></li></ol><h2 id="get-started-with-greenfield-blockchain" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#get-started-with-greenfield-blockchain" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Get Started with Greenfield Blockchain</h2>',4);function j(q,R){const o=r("RouterLink"),i=r("ExternalLinkIcon");return l(),d("div",null,[u,f,e("p",null,[n("The "),m,n(" plays a pivotal role in the "),t(o,{to:"/docs/introduction/ecosystem-player.html"},{default:a(()=>[n("Greenfield ecosystem")]),_:1}),n(".
