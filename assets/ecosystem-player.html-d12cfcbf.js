They get involved in the governance and staking of the blockchain. They form a P2P network that is similar to other PoS blockchain networks.</p><p>Meanwhile, they accept and process transactions to allow users to operate their objects stored on Greenfield. They maintain the metadata of Greenfield as the blockchain state, which is the control panel for both Storage Providers (SPs) and users. These two parties use and update these states to operate the object storage.</p><p>The network topology of Greenfield validators is similar to the existing secure validator setup of PoS blockchains. &quot;Sentry Nodes&quot; are used to defend against DDoS and provide a secure private network, as shown in the below diagram.</p><div align="center"><img src="'+h+'" height="80%" width="80%"></div><div align="center"><i>Figure Greenfield Blockchain Network</i></div><h3 id="greenfield-relayers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#greenfield-relayers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Greenfield Relayers</h3><p>The Greenfield Relayer is a bidirectional relaying tool that facilitates communication between Greenfield and BSC. This standalone process can only be run by Greenfield validators. The relayer independently monitors cross-chain events occurring on BSC and Greenfield, and persists them into a database. Once a few blocks confirm the event and reach finality, the relayer will sign a message using the BLS private key to confirm the event, and broadcast the signed event (known as &quot;the vote&quot;) through the P2P network on the Greenfield network. Once enough votes from the Greenfield relayer are collected, the relayer will assemble a cross-chain package transaction and submit it to the BSC or Greenfield network.</p><h3 id="storage-providers-sps" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#storage-providers-sps" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Storage Providers (SPs)</h3><p>Storage Providers are professional individuals and organizations who run a series of services to provide data services based on the Greenfield blockchain.</p><h3 id="greenfield-dapps" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#greenfield-dapps" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Greenfield dApps</h3><p>Greenfield dApps are applications that provide functions based on Greenfield storage and its related economic traits to solve some problems of their users.</p><h2 id="participate-in-the-ecosystem" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#participate-in-the-ecosystem" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Participate in the Ecosystem</h2>',18);function g(v,u){const t=l("RouterLink");return s(),n("div",null,[f,a("ul",null,[a("li",null,[r(t,{to:"/docs/greenfield-blockchain/cli/validator-staking.html"},{default:i(()=>[e("Become A Validator")]),_:1}),e(": validators secure the Greenfield by validating and relaying transactions, proposing, verifying and finalizing blocks.")]),a("li",null,[r(t,{to:"/docs/greenfield-blockchain/cli/storage-provider.html"},{default:i(()=>[e("Become A Storage Provider")]),_:1}),e(": SPs store the objects' real data, i.e. the payload data. and get paid by providing storage services.")])])])}const y=o(p,[["render",g],["__file","ecosystem-player.html.vue"]]);export{y as default};
