Any BNB holder can contribute to this deposit to support proposal, the submitter is not mandatory to provide the deposit itself, thought it is usually filled by proposal maker. To transit a newly created proposal into active status, <code>MinDeposit</code> need to be met, otherwise proposal will stay inactive. Once deposit end time comes, the proposal will be destroyed and all deposits will be burned. For proposals which deposits reaches minimum threshold, status turn into active and <code>voting period</code> starts.</p><h2 id="voting-period" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#voting-period" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Voting period:</h2><p>All bonded BNB holders get the right to vote on proposals with one of following options:</p><ul><li>Yes: Approval of the proposal in its current form.</li><li>No: Disapproval of the proposal in its current form.</li><li>NoWithVeto: Which indicates a proposal either (1) spam (2) infringes on minority interests (3) violates rules of engagement</li><li>Abstain: The voter wishes to contribute to quorum without voting for or against a proposal.</li></ul><p>Voters may change their vote at any time before voting period ends, be aware of that voting power is measured in terms of bonded BNB, and delegators inherit the vote of validators they are delegated to.
